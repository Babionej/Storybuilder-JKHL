Once upon a time there was a 
Narwhal swimming in the ocean
Causing a commotion
The Narwhal was friends with an elf named Buddy in the deep ocean
The Narwhal then realized that Buddy can't breathe underwater
The Narwhal grinned and dragged him down deeper
The Narwahl stated, "It is all ogre now."
The Narwahl thought Buddy looked tasty, and since he was already dead, the nameless Narwahl ate him for a snack
