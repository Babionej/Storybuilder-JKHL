Once upon a time there was a 
Narwhal swimming in the ocean
Causing a commotion
The Narwhal was friends with an elf named Buddy in the deep ocean
The Narwhal then realized that Buddy can't breathe underwater
The Narwhal grinned and dragged him down deeper
The Narwahl stated, "It is all ogre now."
The Narwahl thought Buddy looked tasty, and since he was already dead, the nameless Narwahl ate him for a snack
All-in-all, it was a great day for the Narwhal and decided to look for his next "friend"
But as he was about to search he realized he needed to clean his teeth, so he headed towards P Sherman 42 Walloby Way, Sydney
Then, Kali woke up from her very weird dream. Like dis if u crei evr tim.
Then, Heather was very confused because she lives under a rock.
